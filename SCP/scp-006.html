          <h2>Special Containment Procedures:</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Whereas the nature of SCP-006 does not warrant any extensive
            containment, a certain level of secrecy is necessary regarding the
            object's existence and properties, for obvious reasons. The
            following procedures are required not for personnel safety, but to
            deny or hide knowledge of SCP-006's effects from the personnel who
            interact with it.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              : All personnel interacting with SCP-006 in any physical way are
              required to wear modified Class VI BNC suits. Before personnel are
              allowed to perform procedures, they must be briefed with Material
              SCP-006B or SCP-006C. SCP-006A Briefing is the correct one and is
              restricted to only those with O5 clearance. To ensure personnel
              are wearing suits properly, they are to be submerged into a pool
              of water. Any air bubbles spotted signify a leak in the suit.
            </li>
            <li>
              : Procedures with SCP-006 are to be carried out under extreme
              surveillance. In case of contact with SCP-006, the commander in
              charge will announce Procedure 006-Xi-12, which the personnel have
              been briefed to believe to mean high toxicity is present and they
              must evacuate.
            </li>
            <li>
              : Any procedure in which liquid is acquired from SCP-006 must be
              approved by three (3) O5 level personnel. The liquid is to be
              transferred in a Quad-Sealant Container and under armed guard.
            </li>
            <li>
              : If at any time personnel come into contact with SCP-006 or
              liquid from SCP-006, they are to be confined and terminated after
              sufficient studies are done. Due to the nature of SCP-006, the
              most effective termination method is incineration. (For full
              report, see file SCP006-TerO5)

          <h3>Description:</h3>
          <p>
            SCP-006 is a very small spring located 60 km west of Astrakhan.
            Foundation Command was aware of its existence since the 19th
            century, but were unable to secure it until 1991 due to political
            reasons. On the spot of the spring, a chemical factory has been
            constructed as a disguise, with the majority of laborers under
            Foundation and/or Russian control. The liquid emitted from the
            spring has been chemically identified as simple mineral water in
            1902, but has the unusual property of "health".
          </p>
          <p>
            Ingesting the liquid produces the following properties in human
            beings: the ability to regenerate DNA damaged by sufficient
            duplication, heightened excitement of cellular duplication, vastly
            improved abilities in the repair of damaged tissue, and a
            frightening increase in the effectiveness of the human immune
            system. Upon testing the liquid on animal subjects, hostile bacteria
            and viral agents were destroyed immediately. Many reptiles and birds
            were unaffected, while higher primates experienced the same benefits
            as humans.
